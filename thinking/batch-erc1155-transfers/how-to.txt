to make this efficient, I need to know:

(i)  unique addresses,
(ii) tokenIds of those addresses

non-compatible solution:
change a signature of the function to accept a list of unique addresses
and then a list of lists of tokenIds

all of the solutions are in fact non-compatible, since I need to add amounts
